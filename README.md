# gnn-geometry-uai

## 1. Overview
This repository contains the implementation and experiments of different graph operators.

## 2. Setup
### 2-1. Installation

**Dependencies**
   * pytorch 1.10
   * pytorch geometric 2.0.5

**Installation**

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2-2. Datasets

The `data\` folder contains source file for:
* Cora

## 3. Usage

* Newly defined families of operators have been implemented in `operators.py`
* `experiments-datasets-demo.ipynb` gives a demo on how to apply these operators on node classification task. 

## 4. Examples

All the examples are to show the effect of the type of operators in the resulting embedding space. The target task is limited to node prediction tasks.
